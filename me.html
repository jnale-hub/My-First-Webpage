                <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500"> I remember badly wanting to have a touch-screen cellphone when I was a kid and play games with it, I

                    the

                    learning and at this time where everything is accessible, we should maximize it and make it on our
                    advantage. We should not waste our time doing nothing, learn every skills you are interested at.
                    Learn
                    new language, read a lot of resources from the internet, learn a new hobby, and many many more. </p>

                <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500">During the pandemic, I tried learning Spanish on Duolingo app and I loved it. Spanish has a lot of
                    common
                    words with Filipino so it was not foreign to me and now I can speak basic Spanish though not very
                    fluently.</p>

                <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500">I also tried learning chess on Chess.com and I also loved it, I bought a chess board and played with
                    my
                    brothers and guess what, they can't beat me anymore.</p>

                <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500">And of course programming, CS50x is actually the first course I take to learn programming and
                    introduce
                    me to computer science, I have never had an experience with it before, I do not even have any idea
                    about
                    binary code and JavaScript, but I was very interested to learn it. </p>

                <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500">
                    Everything happens when I tumbled on a tiktok video about this course and how it is free and open
                    for
                    everyone and how it came from Harvard which is my dream university. And then here I am, doing this
                    problem set to finish the course which was very difficult but a very exciting experience.</p>
