               <p>
                   My name is <b>John Mark B. Delima</b> and I am 18 years old and I am from the province of Camarines Sur, Philippines. I am studying Bachelor of Engineering in Technology Major in Electronics in Rinconada State College. My family owns a small eatery in our town, and I have four siblings and my two older brothers study engineering too.

               <h3 class="highlight">I love technology</h3><hr>
               <p>Ever since I was a kid I really love electronic devices and gadgets, and all about technology and how it would greatly affect the future of the world and how humanity will depends on it. </p>
              <p> I remember badly wanting to have a touch-screen cellphone when I was a kid and play games with it, I always borrow my uncle's phone and he would be very annoyed at me, and when I got my first phone at fourteen I was absolutely very excited. 
              </p><p>Until now, I want to get a high-paying job in the future and one of my plan is to buy the latest macbook and iphone because I really want to have them because I have tried them before, but now I am still jobless, no money and trying to learn programming and enter this career.</p>
           </div>
           <div>
               <h3 class="highlight">I love books</h3><hr>
               <p>I am a very curious child, whenever I get bored, I read magazines, newspapers, anything that could train my eyes on reading things and knowing the things I do not know yet. </p> 
               <p>When I turned teenager, I became very into novels and books and my favorite books are The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky and The Fault In Our Stars by John Green, and many more. I like coming of age novels, science fiction, and fantasy books. I am a huge fan of Harry Potter and Dan Brown's novels.</p>
           </div>
           <div>
               <h3 class="highlight">I love movies and series</h3><hr>
               <p>Binging Netflix shows was one of the hobbies I learned from the heights of pandemic, I also like when the movie was actually adapted from a book, I would definitely read it and critically analyze everything after watching the movie. </p>
<p>
My favorites are Money Heist, Harry Potter Series, Sex Education, The Good Doctor, and Game of Thrones. I love watching them alone at 1.5x speed, but I really hope someday I would find someone special and we will watch every movies and series together and be obsessed about them.</p>
           </div>
           <div>
               <h3 class="highlight">I love learning new things</h3><hr>
               <p>One of my teachers said something that greatly influence me up to this day, she said that never stop learning and at this time where everything is accessible, we should maximize it and make it on our advantage. We should not waste our time doing nothing, learn every skills you are interested at. Learn new language, read a lot of resources from the internet, learn a new hobby, and many many more. </p>

<p>During the pandemic, I tried learning Spanish on Duolingo app and I loved it. Spanish has a lot of common words with Filipino so it was not foreign to me and now I can speak basic Spanish though not very fluently.</p>

<p>I also tried learning chess on Chess.com and I also loved it, I bought a chess board and played with my brothers and guess what, they can't beat me anymore.</p>

<p>And of course programming, CS50x is actually the first course I take to learn programming and introduce me to computer science, I have never had an experience with it before, I do not even have any idea about binary code and JavaScript, but I was very interested to learn it. </p>

<p>
Everything happens when I tumbled on a tiktok video about this course and how it is free and open for everyone and how it came from Harvard which is my dream university. And then here I am, doing this problem set to finish the course which was very difficult but a very exciting experience.</p>
