            <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500">
                This project is for <b>Problem Set 8</b> on <b>CS50X Introduction to Computer Science</b> where we are
                given
                a task to build our own webpage!</p>

            <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500">This webpage was built using <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, and <b>Javascript</b>, and with specific
                implementations from the course. I am very excited to build my very first own webpage as I go through
                the
                course. </p>

            <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500"> Every task from the course is difficult and tricky but it makes me feel excited every week because I
                learn a
                lot of things about programming like creating this, learning languages like C and Python, and many more;
                thinking logically and improving my skills and someday be a programmer as what I dream of every day (and
                to
                be rich someday!!!).</p>

            <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500">I love <b>CS50</b> because it is a great material for people who want to learn computer science and
                programming in their homes without spending money, with great resources, self-paced, and with a very
                great
                professor <b>Sir David J. Malan.</b></p>

            <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500">This webpage is my very first webpage and I donâ€™t know what to put here so I just make a webpage about
                myself, my hobbies and favorite books and movies and series, plus thanking people that are important to
                me
                and had a huge part in my life.</p>

            <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500">I really hope that I will finish this course and be broud that I studied at Harverd, andyeah, thanks, and
                welcome to my very first webpage!
