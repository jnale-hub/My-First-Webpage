           <p>
               This project is for <b>Problem Set 8</b> on <b>CS50X Introduction to Computer Science</b> where we are given a task to build our own webpage!</p>

           <p>This webpage was built using <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, and <b>Javascript</b>, and with specific implementations from the course. I am very excited to build my very first own webpage as I go through the course. </p>

          <p> Every task from the course is difficult and tricky but it makes me feel excited every week because I learn a lot of things about programming like creating this, learning languages like C and Python, and many more; thinking logically and improving my skills and someday be a programmer as what I dream of every day (and to be rich someday!!!).</p>

           <p>I love <b>CS50</b> because it is a great material for people who want to learn computer science and programming in their homes without spending money, with great resources, self-paced, and with a very great professor <b>Sir David J. Malan.</b></p>

           <p>This webpage is my very first webpage and I don’t know what to put here so I just make a webpage about myself, my hobbies and favorite books and movies and series, plus thanking people that are important to me and had a huge part in my life.</p>

           <p>I really hope that I will finish this course and be broud that I studied at Harverd, andyeah, thanks, and welcome to my very first webpage!
